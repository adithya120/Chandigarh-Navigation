# Chandigarh-Navigation
Navigation Program Using Dijkstra's Algorithm

Overview

This repository contains a Python-based navigation program that utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph. The program can be used for route planning, navigation systems, and other shortest path applications.

Features

Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path.

Supports graph representation using an adjacency list.

Accepts user input for source and destination nodes.

Provides visual representation of paths (optional, if using visualization libraries like networkx).
